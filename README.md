# Power-up-Trazabilidad
📝💡 Power-up-Traceability Microservice

This microservice is part of a project to manage a food court. It allows registering logs with the states and times that a specific restaurant's order takes, in order to track the traceability of that restaurant. To test it, a connection to a NoSQL database 🗄️ (MongoDB) is required.

The microservice is built using the hexagonal architecture 🏛️, leveraging Swagger 📚 for API documentation. It is implemented with Spring Boot 🍃 and Java 17 ☕, and the project is managed using Gradle 📦.
